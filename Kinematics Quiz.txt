const questions = [
{
q: "1. What physical quantity is represented by the gradient of a displacement–time graph?",
options: ["Speed", "Velocity", "Acceleration", "Distance"],
answer: 1,
explain: "Gradient of displacement–time graph = change in displacement ÷ time, which is velocity."
},
{
q: "2. A body moves with constant velocity. Which statement about its acceleration is correct?",
options: ["It is constant but non-zero", "It is increasing", "It is zero", "It is decreasing"],
answer: 2,
explain: "Constant velocity means no change in velocity, hence acceleration is zero."
},
{
q: "3. What does the area under a velocity–time graph represent?",
options: ["Acceleration", "Distance travelled", "Displacement", "Speed"],
answer: 2,
explain: "Area under v–t graph gives displacement (taking direction into account)."
},
{
q: "4. A car accelerates uniformly from rest. Which equation of motion is suitable to find its velocity after time t?",
options: ["s = ut + ½at²", "v = u + at", "v² = u² + 2as", "a = (v − u)/t"],
answer: 1,
explain: "v = u + at directly links velocity, acceleration and time."
},
{
q: "5. Which of the following quantities is a vector?",
options: ["Speed", "Distance", "Time", "Velocity"],
answer: 3,
explain: "Velocity has both magnitude and direction."
},
{
q: "6. A runner completes one full lap of a circular track and stops at the starting point. What is the displacement?",
options: ["Equal to circumference", "Zero", "Maximum", "Depends on speed"],
answer: 1,
explain: "Final position equals initial position, so displacement is zero."
},
{
q: "7. Which velocity–time graph represents uniform acceleration?",
options: [
"Straight line with constant gradient",
"Horizontal straight line",
"Curved line",
"Zig-zag line"
],
answer: 0,
explain: "Uniform acceleration means velocity increases at a constant rate → straight line."
},
{
q: "8. What is the SI unit of acceleration?",
options: ["m s⁻¹", "m s⁻²", "km h⁻¹", "N"],
answer: 1,
explain: "Acceleration = change in velocity per second → m s⁻²."
},
{
q: "9. The gradient of a velocity–time graph represents:",
options: ["Speed", "Acceleration", "Displacement", "Distance"],
answer: 1,
explain: "Gradient = change in velocity ÷ time = acceleration."
},
{
q: "10. A car accelerates at 4 m s⁻² for 3 s. What is its change in velocity?",
options: ["4 m s⁻¹", "7 m s⁻¹", "12 m s⁻¹", "24 m s⁻¹"],
answer: 2,
explain: "Change in velocity = at = 4 × 3 = 12 m s⁻¹."
},
{
q: "11. Which equation is used when displacement, initial velocity, acceleration and time are known?",
options: ["v = u + at", "s = ut + ½at²", "v² = u² + 2as", "a = (v − u)/t"],
answer: 1,
explain: "s = ut + ½at² relates displacement directly."
},
{
q: "12. An object slowing down has:",
options: ["Positive acceleration", "Negative acceleration", "Zero acceleration", "Increasing velocity"],
answer: 1,
explain: "Acceleration acts opposite to direction of motion when slowing down."
},
{
q: "13. What does a horizontal line on a velocity–time graph indicate?",
options: ["Uniform acceleration", "Zero velocity", "Constant velocity", "Increasing acceleration"],
answer: 2,
explain: "Velocity does not change → constant velocity."
},
{
q: "14. Which statement about distance and displacement is correct?",
options: [
"They are always equal",
"Displacement can be greater than distance",
"Distance is a scalar, displacement is a vector",
"Distance has direction"
],
answer: 2,
explain: "Distance is scalar; displacement has magnitude and direction."
},
{
q: "15. A cyclist moves at constant speed in a straight line. What is the acceleration?",
options: ["Increasing", "Decreasing", "Zero", "Maximum"],
answer: 2,
explain: "No change in velocity → acceleration is zero."
},
{
q: "16. What happens to acceleration when velocity is constant?",
options: ["It increases", "It decreases", "It is zero", "It is negative"],
answer: 2,
explain: "Constant velocity means no acceleration."
},
{
q: "17. Which graph best represents constant velocity?",
options: [
"Straight line displacement–time graph",
"Curved displacement–time graph",
"Straight line velocity–time graph with gradient",
"Curved velocity–time graph"
],
answer: 0,
explain: "Constant velocity gives constant gradient on displacement–time graph."
},
{
q: "18. What is meant by uniform acceleration?",
options: [
"Velocity is constant",
"Acceleration increases",
"Acceleration is constant",
"Speed is constant"
],
answer: 2,
explain: "Uniform means constant."
},
{
q: "19. If the area under a velocity–time graph is zero, what can be concluded?",
options: [
"Distance is zero",
"Acceleration is zero",
"Displacement is zero",
"Speed is zero"
],
answer: 2,
explain: "Positive and negative areas cancel → zero displacement."
},
{
q: "20. Which situation gives zero displacement but non-zero distance?",
options: [
"Moving 10 m east",
"Standing still",
"Moving 5 m east then 5 m west",
"Moving in a straight line"
],
answer: 2,
explain: "Final position equals initial position, but distance travelled is 10 m."
